# Asynchronous Lab

If you are working through this training on your own time, you should use the [asynchronous version](./asynchronous_lab.ipynb) of the lab (provided in this directory) since the [live session](../notebooks/4-hands_on_data_analysis_lab.ipynb) version won't be open. You can work on the exercises in [`asynchronous_lab.ipynb`](./asynchronous_lab.ipynb) and review some sample solutions in [`solutions.ipynb`](./solutions.ipynb).
